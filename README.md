# sql_data_warehouse_project
Building a modern DataWarehouse with SQL server, including ETL Process, Data Modeling and Analytics   

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, encompassing the entire data lifecycle from extraction to analytics. The primary focus areas include:
Data Architecture: Implementing a structured data warehouse design utilizing the Medallion Architecture, which organizes data into Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleaned and enriched data), and Gold (business-ready data) layers.
ETL Processes: Developing robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines to seamlessly ingest data from diverse source systems into the data warehouse, ensuring data quality and consistency.
Data Modeling: Constructing optimized fact and dimension tables following best practices in data modeling to support efficient analytical querying and reporting.
Analytics & Reporting: Creating insightful SQL-based reports and interactive dashboards that provide actionable business intelligence, facilitating informed decision-making.

Objectives
Design and Implementation: Build a scalable and efficient data warehouse architecture using SQL Server, adhering to industry standards and best practices.
ETL Development: Establish automated ETL workflows that accurately extract data from multiple sources, perform necessary transformations, and load it into the warehouse with minimal latency.
Data Quality Assurance: Implement data validation and cleansing procedures to maintain high data quality and reliability within the warehouse.
Performance Optimization: Optimize database performance through proper indexing, partitioning, and query tuning to ensure rapid data retrieval and analysis.
Visualization and Reporting: Develop comprehensive reports and dashboards that visualize key metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights.

Repository Structure
/datasets: Contains raw datasets sourced from various systems, serving as the input for ETL processes.
/docs: Includes detailed documentation of the project's architecture, data models, ETL workflows, and usage guidelines.
/scripts: Houses SQL scripts and stored procedures for database creation, ETL operations, and data transformations.
/tests: Comprises test cases and validation scripts to ensure the accuracy and integrity of ETL processes and data models.

Getting Started
Prerequisites: Ensure that SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) are installed on your system.
Clone the Repository: Use git clone to download the project files to your local machine.
Set Up the Database: Execute the provided database creation scripts in SSMS to set up the data warehouse schema.
Load Initial Data: Run the ETL scripts to populate the warehouse with data from the /datasets directory.
Explore Analytics: Open the reporting scripts or dashboard files to view and interact with the analytical outputs.
